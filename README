Here are some scripts (starting from just one... more to come as I get
around to doing the work to decouple them from our systems) I wrote at
Broadband Mechanics to help make the my life and the lives of the
other sysadmins easier.  Hopefully others might find them useful too!

src/configure_replication

  This configures MySQL replication on a pair of MySQL servers,
  handling setting up the replication slave user, dumping the master
  database, moving an existing DB out of the way on the slave, and
  loading the data into the slave.

First, you'll need to create a file called config.py that describes
your servers.  Copy src/config.py.sample to src/config.py and follow
the prompts.
